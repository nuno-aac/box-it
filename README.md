I will not be publishing this to the chrome web store any time soon because i do not have 5$.

# If you want to use it anyway

`$ yarn`

`$ yarn build`

The unpacked extension will be generated in the `/dist` folder.

The you can add it to your favorite chromium flavour using a variantion of [this tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked).
